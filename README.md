# ⛽ Fuel Queue Management System (FQMS)

A modern web application for checking real-time fuel availability and queue status at fuel stations. Customers can browse stations and see estimated wait times, while station owners can manage fuel availability and track queue metrics for their station.

**Version**: 2.0
**Status**: Production Ready ✅

---

## 📖 Problem Statement

Fuel shortages and long queues make real-time visibility valuable. This project reduces unnecessary travel by surfacing availability and queue-related information per station, helping users make informed decisions and saving time.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-based Access**: Register and log in as either a **Customer** or an **Owner**.
- **Secure Sessions**: PHP session management with client-side credential persistence.

### Customer Dashboard
- **Real-Time Station Data**: View all stations with current petrol/diesel availability, queue lengths, and computed status (Available / Limited / No Fuel).
- **Smart Estimated Wait Times**: Instantly see how long the wait will be based on queue lengths.
- **Search & Filter**: Easily find nearby or specific stations.

### Owner Dashboard
- **Station Management**: Owners manage the station linked to their account.
- **Fuel Toggles**: Quickly update `fuel_availability` status for Petrol and Diesel.
- **Queue Metrics**: View and update the current queue length.

### Estimated Waiting Time Logic
- **Simple Formula**: `Estimated Waiting Time = Queue Length × 2 minutes`
- **Real-time Display**: Shows on both customer and owner dashboards instantly.
- *Examples: 5 vehicles = 10 minutes | 12 vehicles = 24 minutes | 20 vehicles = 40 minutes*

### API Endpoints (Admin Only)

All endpoints require admin authentication and return JSON.

#### User Management
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `admin/users.php` | GET | List users (page, limit, search, role, status filters) |
| `admin/user-actions.php` | POST | Suspend/activate/delete user |

#### Station Management
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `admin/stations.php` | GET | List stations (page, limit, search, approval_status filters) |
| `admin/station-actions.php` | POST | Approve/reject station |

#### Reports Moderation
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `admin/reports.php` | GET | List reports (page, limit, search, status filters) |
| `admin/report-actions.php` | POST | Review/resolve/spam/delete report |

#### System Monitoring
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `admin/statistics.php` | GET | Dashboard statistics (users, stations, reports, alerts, fuel availability) |
| `admin/alerts.php` | GET | List system alerts (page, limit, acknowledged filter) |
| `admin/alert-actions.php` | POST | Acknowledge/delete alerts |
| `admin/audit-logs.php` | GET | View admin action logs (page, limit, action, user filters) |

#### Data Export
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `admin/export.php` | GET | Export CSV (type: users, stations, reports) |

### Creating Admin Accounts

**Method 1: Database Direct**
```sql
-- Generate secure password hash (replace YourSecurePassword):
-- php -r "echo password_hash('YourSecurePassword', PASSWORD_DEFAULT);"

INSERT INTO users (name, national_id, email, password, role, is_active)
VALUES ('Admin Name', '000000001', 'admin@fqms.local', '[hashed_password]', 'admin', 1);
```

**Method 2: Via Backdoor Script** (use in development only)
Create `backend/create_admin.php`:
```php
<?php
require 'config.php';
$pdo = db();
$email = 'admin@example.com';
$password = password_hash('SecurePassword123', PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('INSERT INTO users (name, national_id, email, password, role) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)');
$stmt->execute(['System Admin', '000000000', $email, $password, 'admin']);
echo "Admin account created: $email";
?>
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Change default passwords immediately in production
- Store passwords securely
- Use strong, unique passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Remove creation scripts after use

### Database Schema Updates

Run the following SQL to add admin support to existing installations:

```bash
# Import admin schema updates
mysql -u root -p fqms < database/admin_schema_update.sql
```

**New Tables**:
- `audit_logs`: Track all admin actions
- `admin_alerts`: System alerts and notifications
- `system_settings`: Admin configuration

**Modified Tables**:
- `users`: Added `is_active`, `suspension_reason`, `suspended_at`, `suspended_by`
- `fuel_stations`: Added `approval_status`, `rejection_reason`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`
- `reports`: Added `report_status`, `admin_notes`, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Admin endpoints verify role via session
2. **Authorization**: All actions require admin role; non-admins get 403 Forbidden
3. **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with IP address and admin identity
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
5. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prepared statements used throughout
6. **Session Security**: PHP session-based, secure cookies
7. **Rate Limiting**: Recommended for production (implement via web server config)
8. **Password Policy**: Enforce strong passwords for admin accounts
9. **Access Control**: Admin dashboard accessible only to admin role

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Review audit logs weekly for suspicious activity
2. **Alert Response**: Acknowledge critical/high alerts promptly
3. **Data Exports**: Export reports monthly for business analytics
4. **User Management**: Suspend suspicious accounts; delete inactive users
5. **Station Approval**: Review pending stations within 24 hours
6. **Backup**: Regular database backups (before major admin operations)
7. **Testing**: Test admin features in staging before production deployment

### Troubleshooting Admin Issues

- **Cannot access admin dashboard**: Verify user role is 'admin' in database
- **404 on admin API**: Ensure `backend/admin/` folder exists
- **Actions not saving**: Check database permissions and error logs
- **Alerts not appearing**: Verify `admin_alerts` table exists; check system_settings
- **Export failing**: Ensure write permissions; check MySQL user privileges
- **Audit logs empty**: Verify actions are being performed by admin accounts

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- **"503 Database unavailable"**: Start MySQL from your control panel.
- **"401 Authentication required"**: Ensure you are logged in.
- **"404 Station not found"**: Import `database/fqms.sql` to seed the initial data.
- **Queue doesn't update**: Check browser console (F12) for errors.
- **Owner dashboard redirects to customer view**: Ensure your account role is set to `owner` and linked to a station.
